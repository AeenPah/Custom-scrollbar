# 🎨 Custom Scrollbar – Because Default Just Won’t Do  

Ever wanted a **scrollbar OUTSIDE the container**? Well, so did I – and here we are. 😎  

## 🚀 What’s Inside?  
- **HTML** – Holds everything together.  
- **CSS** – Makes it look good.  
- **JavaScript** – Does the heavy lifting.  

## 🛠️ Why This Exists  
Because the default scrollbar just **wouldn't stay outside the container**, and that was unacceptable. 😤  

Now, we have a **custom scrollbar that plays by MY rules!** 🎉  

Enjoy smooth scrolling, my friend. 🚀
